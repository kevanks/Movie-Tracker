# Movie-Tracker

Movie-Tracker or MovieDex is a library of stored movies, tv shows, and anime's a
user can add, edit and delete at will. They can store movies and shows they have and haven't seen. It also allows users to rate and leave comments on these movies or shows.

## Usage

In this application I used Express, Node.js, Mongoose, and EJS.
Mongoose was the database I used to store the data in my application.
Express is what I used to build the application and have all the routes
to be able to create, show, edit, and delete information.
I used EJS to be able to embed JavaScript into an html file directly which made
my life a lot easier.


## approach

I wanted to create a user friendly way to store different forms of media users
can later access and update and delete.


## problems

I have to add a sign up/log in feature so everyone can have access to their own
MovieDex. I also think it needs more styling the bootstrap I added was cool but
I feel like I can do better. Add a button or checkbox that when clicked only
displays the watched or not watched movies.
